def get_cubic_spline_coefs(t, spline_type=0.0):
    """ get_cubic_spline_coefs(t, spline_type='Catmull-Rom')
    
    Calculates the coefficients for a cubic spline and returns them as 
    a tuple. t is the ratio between "left" point and "right" point on the
    lattice.  If performance matters, consider using get_lut() instead.
    
    spline_type can be (case insensitive):
        
        <number between -1 and 1>: Gives a Cardinal spline with the
        specified number as its tension parameter. A Cardinal spline 
        is a type of Hermite spline, where the tangents are calculated 
        using points p0 and p3; the coefficients can be directly applied
        to p0 p1 p2 p3. 
        
        'Catmull-Rom' or 'Cardinal0': is a cardinal spline a tension of 0.
        An interesting note: if we would create two quadractic splines, that
        would fit a polynomial "f(t) = a*t*t + b*t + c" to the first three
        and last three knots respectively, and if we would then combine 
        the two using linear interpolation, we would obtain a catmull-rom
        spline. I don't know whether this is how the spline was designed,
        or if this is a "side-effect".
        
        'B-pline': Basis spline. Not an interpolating spline, but an
        approximating spline. Here too, the coeffs can be applied to p0-p3.
        
        'Hermite': Gives the Hermite coefficients to be applied to p1 m1 p2
        m2 (in this order), where p1 p2 are the closest knots and m1 m2 the
        tangents.
        
        'Lagrange': The Lagrange spline or Lagrange polynomial is an 
        interpolating spline. It is the same as Newton polynomials, but
        implemented in a different manner (wiki). The Newton implementation
        should be more efficient, but this implementation is much simpler, 
        and is very similar to the B-spline implementation (only the 
        coefficients are different!). Also, when for example interpolating 
        an image, coefficients are reused often and can be precalculated
        to enhance speed.
        
        'Lanczos': Lanczos interpolation (windowed sync funcion). Note that
        this is not really a spline, and that sum of the coefficients is
        not exactly 1. Often used in audio processing. The Lanczos spline is
        very similar to the Cardinal spline with a tension of -0.25.
        
        'quadratic': Quadratic interpolation with a support of 4, essentially
        the addition of the two quadratic polynoms.
        
        'linear': Linear interpolation. Effective support is 2. Added
        for completeness and testing.
        
        'nearest': Nearest neighbour interpolation. Added for completeness
        and testing.
